# Forum Manager
### Thread-weaver

Forum Manager is designed to handle the operational overhead of running a community. It automates the maintenance of forum channels—pruning irrelevant content, enforcing quality standards, and providing tools to keep discussions structured.

## Features

### Smart Cleanup
The cleanup suite automates forum maintenance based on specific triggers:
* **Inactive Threads:** Automatically remove or archive threads after a defined period of inactivity.
* **Orphaned Content:** Clean up threads from users who have left the server or threads missing their original starter message.
* **Pattern Matching:** Use Regex to target and remove threads containing specific pings or content patterns.

### Proactive Automod
Maintain high-quality discussions with automated filters that catch low-effort or repetitive posts:
* **Content Filtering:** Blacklist specific words or use advanced pattern matching to flag and act on prohibited phrases.
* **Quality Control:** Enforce minimum character requirements to prevent low-effort or "one-word" threads.
* **Duplicate Prevention:** Detect and block repetitive threads from the same user to keep the forum feed unique.

### Utility Commands
Streamlined tools to help staff manage and manipulate forum structures on the fly:
* **Mass Recovery:** Quickly restore archived posts back into active rotation.
* **Forum Templates:** Copy existing forum configurations and settings to new channels instantly.
* **Bulk Purge:** Clear all threads in a forum with the option to return thread content to the original authors before deletion.
* **Synchronization:** Tools to ensure all forum threads are correctly indexed and managed by the bot.
